# Web Development Project 3 - Flashcards App

Submitted by: **Siva Macharla Vimjam**

This web app: A flashcard application that displays a set of cards one at a time. Each card shows either a question or answer, flips on correct input to reveal the other side, and includes features like answer checking, streak tracking, shuffle mode, and mastery removal.

Time spent: **4 hours** spent in total

## Required Features

The following required functionality is completed:

-  The app displays the title of the card set, a short description, and the total number of cards.
-  A list of card pairs is created using an array of objects, each containing `question` and `answer`.
-  A single card is displayed at a time.
-  Only one half of the card is shown initially.
-  A clearly labeled input box and submit button allow the user to enter a guess before seeing the answer.
-  Clicking the submit button with an incorrect answer shows visual feedback (`Try again!`).
-  Clicking the submit button with a correct answer shows the correct answer (`Correct!`) and flips the card.
-  Users can navigate forward and backward through the cards using next/previous buttons.
-  Wrap-around navigation is **not allowed** â€” buttons are disabled at the ends.

## Stretch Features

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

-  **Shuffle button** randomizes the card sequence.
-  Cards remain in sequence unless shuffled.
-  User answers are accepted even if partially correct (ignores case, punctuation, extra spaces).
-  Current and longest streak counters are displayed and updated:
  - **Current Streak** increments on correct answers.
  - **Longest Streak** updates if current exceeds max.
  -  Incorrect answers reset current streak.
-  A **"Mark as Mastered"** button removes the current card from the pool.
-  When all cards are mastered, a congratulatory message is shown.
-  Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text.
-  Cards are styled differently based on difficulty (easy/medium/hard) and subject.

## Notes

- Implementing state-driven card flipping only after a correct guess required careful state management.
- Input had to reset correctly between cards to avoid leaking prior values.
- Streak and mastery logic had to be managed cleanly to avoid removing wrong cards.
- Extra attention was paid to accessibility, button disabling, and mobile-friendly layout.
